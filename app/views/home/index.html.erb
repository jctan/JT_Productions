           Before I attended Baruch College in Fall 2011, I went to <a href="http://www.ccny.cuny.edu" target="_new">The City College of New York</a> for a year, coming right out of high school. I mainly took the General Education coursework and during the time of my studies at CCNY, my favorite subject was <a href= "http://www.khanacademy.org/math/calculus" target="_new"> calculus</a>.

            In the summer of 2013, I was a Data Assurance Intern for the Data Strategy & Operations team at <a href = "http://www.standardandpoors.com/" target="_new"> Standard & Poor's Ratings Services </a> in New York City, an American financial services company that is a division of McGraw Hill Financial. They publish financial research and analysis on stocks and bonds. I was working individually and in teams from New York, London, Denver, and Mumbai. The projects I worked on was predominantly in discrepancy metrics analysis on US Public Finance fundamental data, financial reference data, and scorecard metrics on corporate financial data. The tools I used to work on these projects are Toad for Oracle and MS Access, so I have come to rely on SQL heavily.

            <p>During the spring of 2013, I was an Information Technology Assistant at the Office of College Advancement, Baruch College. My main role was IT Support and Management for the entire office infrastructure on hardware, software, and networks. I also have developed and maintained the infrastructure inventory database and time-sheet database using MS Access. As a side project of my own, I built VBA macros that automatically export e-mail attachments of pdf files from MS Outlook to user's desktop. </p>

Qaulity Assurance was a new team that was formed in the Customer Operations Group. Con Edison is a regulated utility providing electric, gass, and steam services in New York City and Westchester County, New York. I mainly worked and managed the meter information systems that focused on interval meters. I also have roles on customer operations, data collection and reporting, Data analytics, Database and Information System Quality Testing. As a side project, I designed VBA macros and Queries in MS Access to improve the team's operations.</p>

I teamed up with my friend and a student from Rutgers - Bryan Li and Micah T. Moore. We created <a href = "projects"> SigniMail </a> that allows the user to see the important emails without ever checking his or her email, and sends directly via SMS (text message) that outlines the sender, subject line, and a breif portion of the body that contains 600 characters based on the specific keyword that the user enters on the web app. SigniMail was built with PHP, bootstrap, and MySQL database.</p>

            <p> In February 2014, I attended <a href = "http://2014s.pennapps.com" target="_new">PennApps</a> at University of Pennsylvania. PennApps is a 48 hour hackathon for hackers to come togther to pitch ideas, and create a hack by the end of the hackathon. I teamed up with fellows who I have met at the hackathon - Tony Xie, Josephy Song, and Waqas Latiff. We built <a href = "http://www.githackacoin.com" target="_new"> HackaCoin (HACK)</a>, a crytocurrency based on "prim number" algorithm to reward students from hackathon communities around the world, along with a web application that is the online wallet and it was built in Ruby on Rails.</p>

            <p> In October 2013, I competed in a 24 hour hackathon at the J.P. Morgan Code for Good Challenge. The non-profit organization, The Center of New York City Neighborhoods (CNYCN), run in partnership with J.P. Morgan Chase's Technology for Social Good team, presented a challenge to create a web application targeted at homeowners, advocacy and policy makers that looks at the changes in flood maps that may impact on housing markets and affordability. We built a web application, <a href = "http://www.joshuanoll.com:4334/ripple/#!" target="_new"> Ripple (NYC Floods)</a>, that uses the LAMP framework and bootstrap as a front-end design. We also implemented the web application with JavaScript, Google Mapping's API, Trulia API, Fizber API, and raw data from NASA and NYTimes.</p>

            <p> I competed and earned Wall of Fame in the 2013 IBM Master the Mainframe Contest. I managed to complete part 1 and part 2 challenges in 4/82 days that involves extensive programming with familiarity in advanced system navigation, application development tasks in Java, Python, SQL, COBOL, JCL as well as hands-on experience with multiple mainframe operating systems, such as Linux on System Z, z/VM, z/OS, z/TPF across the parallel sysplex. </p>

            <p> I participated and earned Wall of Fame in the 2012 IBM Master the Mainframe Contest. I managed to complete part 1 and part 2 challenges that involves debugging, programming, and navigation of the z/OS mainframe. One of the memorable challenges I faced was modifying a C program with Job Control Language (JCL) to have abundant lucky numbers and mersenne prime numbers printed. I also have customized an Interactive System Productivity Facility (ISPF) user interface, a z/OS management facility, using advanced ISPF editor commands. Another cool thing I discovered was compiling and executing a Java program through an z/OS Unix Shell environment. </p>
